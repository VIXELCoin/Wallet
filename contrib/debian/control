Description: peer-to-peer digital currency - standalone transaction tool
 Vixel is an experimental new digital currency that enables instant, private
 payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Vixel uses peer-to-peer
 technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions
 and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. Vixel Core
 is the name of the open source software which enables the use of this currency.
 .
 This package provides vixel-tx, a command-line transaction creation
 tool which can be used without a vixel daemon.  Some means of
 exchanging minimal transaction data with peers is still required.
